============

This is a welcome, sign in, and create account flow for DropBox

Time spent: Approx. 12 hours

User can tap through the 3 welcome screens.
User can follow the create user flow.
On the create user form, the user can tap the back button to go to the page where they can sign in or create an account.
Before creating the account, user can choose to read the terms of service.
After creating the account, user can view the placeholders for Files, Photos, and Favorites as well as the Settings screen.
User can log out from the Settings screen.
User can follow the sign in flow.
User can tap the area for "Having trouble signing in?"
User can log out from the Settings screen.


Notes:
I'm still stuck on the swipe gestures. I followed the direction in class but still getting errors. Will ask in person Wed. I tried using UIScrollView vs the SwipeGestures.
